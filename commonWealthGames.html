                The Commonwealth Games, often referred to as the Friendly Games, is a quadrennial international
                multi-sport event among athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations. The event was first held in 1930,
                and, with the exception of 1942 and 1946 (cancelled due to World War II), have successively run every
                four years since. The Games were called the British Empire Games from 1930 to 1950, the British Empire
                and Commonwealth Games from 1954 to 1966, and British Commonwealth Games from 1970 to 1974. Athletes
                with a disability are included as full members of their national teams since 2002, making the
                Commonwealth Games the first fully inclusive international multi-sport event. In 2018, the Games became
                the first global multi-sport event to feature an equal number of men's and women's medal events and four
                years later they are the first global multi-sport event to have more events for women than men.
